# Exercise - Guess the number

Implement a program in Python which allows a user to guess a random number that the computer has chosen.

You might find the following helpful:

```plaintext
computer chooses random number between 1 and 10

loop until we get it right
    computer asks us to guess

    if the guess is right
        computer says yes
    otherwise
        if the number is too low
            computer says higher
        if the number is too high
            computer says lower
```

**Note:** *There is no automatic testing for this exercise - you are responsible for writing and running your own tests!*
